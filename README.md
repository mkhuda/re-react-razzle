# Razzle Reason React

## How to use
### Install Reason-CLI first

| platform  | install command                          |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| **macOS** | `yarn global add reason-cli@latest-macos` |
| **Linux** | `yarn global add reason-cli@latest-linux`  |
|**Windows**| Please see https://github.com/reasonml/reasonml.github.io/issues/195

Install it and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mkhuda/re-react-razzle.git
cd re-react-razzle
yarn install
yarn start
```
#### NOTE: This example takes a while to install. Stick with it.

Now you can go and edit `src/App.re`. When you make changes, your **browser and server** will Hot Reload. 

## Idea behind the example
This is an example of how to use [Reason React](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react) and Razzle together. Yes, you read that correctly. SSR, Reason, React, HMR.
